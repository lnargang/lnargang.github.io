                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>
                    I am Luciano Nargang, a computer science undergraduate at Indiana University. I am specializing in systems engineering, 
                    and I work with both computer graphics and machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a student researcher at the Indiana University Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering.
                    I work in the GaryFallidis Research Group on the <a href="fury.gl">FURY</a> (Free Unified Rendering in pYthon) project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also involved in the Machine Learning For All club at Indiana University, where I have gained experience in teaching younger
                    students the fascinating world of decision processing!
                </p>
                <p><br>For more information on the involvement I have listed above, please check out my resume and on my LinkedIn! (linked above)</p>
                <p>Eventually, this website will serve as a hub for all of my other personal projects. For now, you can check out what I'm up to using my GitHub.</p>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
